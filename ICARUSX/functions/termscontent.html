We cannot guarantee that we will be able to amend your order in accordance with your instructions.<br>
        All items are subject to availability. We will notify you if any item is not available, the expected availability date, and may offer you an alternative product or service. If the availability of any product or service is delayed and you do not wish to substitute the product or service, upon your request, we will cancel your order and if previously charged, your payment card will be fully refunded for that specific order. We reserve the right to limit the sales of our products and services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction.

        SECTION 6 &ndash; REFUND, AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT &amp; PAYMENT, &amp; CANCELLATION<br></br>
        Icarus Investments can change the monthly membership subscription rate at any time. If the membership subscription rate changes after you subscribe, we will notify you by email and give you an opportunity to cancel. If you wish to cancel your subscription at any time, you must follow the instructions in the knowledge base article &ldquo;How do I cancel?&rdquo; or live chat us at www.icarus-investments.com to request the cancellation. This must be done at least one day before your next subscription due date, or your credit card may still be charged. When canceling your account, you have the option to have the account terminated immediately or by your next due date. There is no pro-rating if you decide to terminate immediately. If you do not cancel at least one day before the next due date, your subscription will automatically continue and the payment card that you provided at the time of enrollment online will be charged the full monthly membership subscription rate provided at the time of enrollment each month until you cancel.<br>
        We have a thirty (30) day refund policy if you are not happy with the service and you are entitled to a full refund of your start-up payment up until 1 day before your next billing due date. If you do not ask for a refund at least one day before your next due date, Icarus Investments will assume you wish to continue with the subscription and charge the regular monthly subscription amount on the due date so you continue with access for the next month. Once the day before your due date has arrived, you will not be entitled to any refund for any payments to Icarus Investments.<br>
        SECTION 7 &ndash; SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT<br></br>
        A Icarus Investments user is responsible for paying all sums due to Icarus Investments in connection with their monthly subscription in accordance with these Terms. The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access.Every calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following month&rsquo;s subscription, together with any other fees for the following month&rsquo;s subscription plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, &ldquo;Fees&rdquo;). Failure by the Icarus Investments user to use any of the services available through the service provided by Icarus Investments does not relieve the Icarus Investments user of their payment obligations under these Terms.<br>
        Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card. Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due. You further acknowledge and agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (unless the subscription is cancelled in accordance with these Terms) and therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount).<br>
        IF YOU ARE A Icarus Investments USER WITH A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBER OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT. IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO Icarus Investments, YOU MAY DO SO THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT DASHBOARD OR BY E-MAILING SUPPORT@BLUEEDGEFINANCIAL.COM AT LEAST TEN (10) DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH.<br>
        Icarus Investments reserves the right to immediately terminate a user&rsquo;s account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice). Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the event Icarus Investments starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in Section 20 below.<br>
        In addition to any Fees, Icarus Investments may also charge applicable value added or other tax.<br></br>

Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 19 and 20 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Utah County, Utah unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA&rsquo;s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Icarus Investments.<br>
        Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.<br>
        The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Utah without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
        You and Icarus Investments agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and Icarus Investments expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.<br>
        Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).<br>
        This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, as amended.<br>
        This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Icarus Investments, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
        YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.<br>
        SECTION 17 &ndash; Icarus Investments&rsquo;S ADDITIONAL REMEDIES<br>

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting Icarus Investments from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Utah County, Utah for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts&rsquo; exclusive jurisdiction or venue.<br>
