<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) creates a standardized process for copyright holders (including software developers) to ask Icarus Investments to take down infringing content. You can find more information about the DMCA at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/rrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Copyright Office&rsquo;s official website.</a></p>
<p>As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. Our guides are NOT legal advice and shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as such.</p>
<h5>Before You Start</h5>
<p><strong>Tell the Truth.</strong>&nbsp;The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your notice of infringement under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621). Submitting false information could also result in civil liability&mdash;that is, you could get sued for money damages.</p>

These notices are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down content.</p>
<p><strong>You May Receive a Counter Notice.</strong>&nbsp;Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice. If they do, we will re-enable the content within 14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content of Icarus Investments.</p>
<p><strong>Icarus Investments Isn&rsquo;t The Judge!</strong>&nbsp;Icarus Investments exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of</p>
